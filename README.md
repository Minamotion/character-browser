# Character Browser
Like character map, but for the web!
## Cool, what else can it do?
Here is the URL for finding "ÿ": [minamotion.github.io/character-browser/?items=33&page=8#0x00FF](https://minamotion.github.io/character-browser/?items=33&page=8#0x00FF)
- The `items` parameter tells the website how much characters to render in one page
- The `page` parameter tells the website what page to load
- The hash is just "ÿ" in **"CharCode"** Hexadecimal *(don't believe me?, run `console.log(String.fromCharCode(0x00ff))` in the console right now)*
